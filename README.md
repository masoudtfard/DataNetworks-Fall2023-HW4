### Network Layer

This project includes two main simulation tasks using OMNeT++ and INET framework:

1. Simulation of OSPF Network:
   - Implements an OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) network.
   - Requires configuring routers to enable ping communication between PC pairs.
   - Involves explaining OSPF principles, advantages, and disadvantages.
   - Explores the rationale behind network area division in OSPF.

2. Visualizing Network Layer Activity:
   - Utilizes NetworkRouteVisualizer to display network layer traffic.
   - Consists of three sub-tasks:
     a) Enabling visualization in a simple wired network with two hosts.
     b) Filtering network path activity in a complex network with routers, switches, and hosts.
     c) Visualizing dynamic path changes in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) using AODV routing.
